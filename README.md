# Python LeetCode Solutions Overview

This repository showcases a curated collection of solutions to selected LeetCode problems, meticulously crafted in Python. The primary objective is to serve as a learning resource, focusing on improving coding skills, mastering algorithms, and data structures, and fostering a deeper understanding of problem-solving techniques.

## Scope and Selection Criteria

The solutions presented here cover a broad spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from beginner to advanced. The selection is based on the relevance to commonly encountered interview questions, the diversity of concepts involved, and the potential for educational insights. While the focus is on competitive programming and technical interviews, the strategies and approaches discussed can be applied broadly to software development challenges.

## Organization

The repository is organized into directories, each dedicated to a specific problem. The naming convention follows the problem number format for ease of navigation. Within each directory, you'll find:

- A Python script (`solution.py`) containing the solution code.
- A markdown file (`README.md`) providing a brief description of the problem, the approach taken, and any additional notes or references.

## Goals

- **Learning**: Serve as a practical guide for learning and honing coding skills.
- **Reference**: Offer a quick reference for solving similar problems during interviews or personal coding challenges.
- **Community Contribution**: Encourage collaboration and feedback, fostering a community of learners.

## Contributions

Contributions are warmly welcomed. Whether you wish to submit solutions for other problems, suggest improvements, or share alternative approaches, please feel free to reach out. Contributions should adhere to the existing structure and quality standards of the repository.
